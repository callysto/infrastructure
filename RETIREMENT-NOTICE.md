## Callysto Hub and Callysto Online Learning Platform Retirements

The Callysto Hub ([hub.callysto.ca](hub.callysto.ca)) and the Callysto online learning platform ([courses.callysto.ca](courses.callysto.ca)) will be retired on **June 30, 2024**. This change only affects those who use the Callysto Hub, the Callysto online learning platform or both, and the Callysto website will be updated to reflect this change.

As part of the recent [announcement](https://www.cybera.ca/a-fond-farewell-and-securing-the-future-callysto-transitions-to-a-new-phase/) regarding the transition of Callysto to a new phase, Cybera and the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences are ending their support for existing Callysto-related infrastructure and platforms, which they have maintained since 2017. After June 30th, Callysto will begin transitioning existing resources and systems to those with less infrastructure and operational requirements. 

We will notify all registered users to download any needed data from their Callysto Hub accounts before June 30, 2024. We will also send a notice to current users registered in the Callysto Computational Thinking and Data Science courses to complete any remaining coursework before June 30, 2024. 

### Next steps:

* Between today and June 30, users of the Callysto Hub and the Callysto online learning platform will continue to access the service as usual, but they will need to download any required data and complete any remaining coursework, respectively. 
* At 5:00 pm Mountain Time on June 30, 2024, the Callysto Hub and the Callysto online learning platform will be retired and will no longer be accessible. 
* Users with data still in the Callysto Hub after this point will need to contact support@callysto.ca to attempt to retrieve the data. We will service these requests as soon as possible but cannot guarantee prompt data recovery. 
* After June 30, 2024, Callysto learning resources and online courses will still be available via the website but access will not require a login to access and the technology will use the user’s browser storage to store data. Please note that this storage is temporary and if you delete your browser data (e.g. cache, history, cookies, etc.) the Callysto data will also be erased.

### To download your data from the Callysto Hub before June 30th, the easiest way is to:

1. In a browser window, go to hub.callysto.ca and log in using your existing Google or Microsoft account.
2. From the dashboard Files view, select the individual files (such as .ipynb files) you want to save. Note, you cannot select and download folders, you must navigate into the folder and select the files you want to save.
3. Press the “Download” button near the top of the window to begin downloading the selected files. Note, you may need to repeat this process several times for files located in folders.
4. *Optional*: For users comfortable with the command line, you may be able to create a zip file archive of important folders by opening the terminal application and using a command like “zip -r lesson-plans.zip lesson-plans” where “lesson-plans” is the folder you wish to save. The result should be a file called “lesson-plans.zip” containing the contents of that folder. You can download the zip file using the instructions above.

If you have any questions please email **contact@callysto.ca** with any questions or concerns. 

Thank you for all your support and we look forward to continuing offering Callysto services in more ways in the future.
